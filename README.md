# ðŸŽ¬ MovieTracker

MovieTracker is a RESTful web API built with ASP.NET Core, designed to manage a collection of movies. It uses an in-memory database to store movie data and includes several endpoints for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting movies. The project also supports CORS and provides Swagger integration for API documentation.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **In-Memory Database**: The application uses an in-memory database to store movie details, making it easy to set up and run without requiring an external database.
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Provides full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for movie records.
- **Swagger Integration**: Automatically generates API documentation and allows testing through the Swagger UI.
- **CORS Support**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to allow API access from any origin.
- **JSON Seed Data**: Automatically seeds the in-memory database with movie data loaded from a JSON file.

## ðŸ“¡ Endpoints

- **GET /api/movies**: Retrieve all movies or filter by category (optional query parameter `category`).
- **GET /api/movies/{id}**: Retrieve a movie by its ID.
- **POST /api/movies**: Add a new movie.
- **PUT /api/movies/{id}**: Update an existing movie by ID.
- **DELETE /api/movies/{id}**: Delete a movie by ID.
